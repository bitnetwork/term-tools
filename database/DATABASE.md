## Paramatized Strings
Strings may be paramatized (indicated in the notes), in which they will accept
either some numbers or strings as paramaters.

Token | Description
----- | -----------------------------------------
%%    | Output a literal precent character
%d    | Pop number on the stack and print it
%o    | Pop number on the stack and print it in octal
%x    | Pop number on the stack and print it in hexadecimal
%X    | Pop number on the stack and print it in hexadecimal with uppercase digits
%s    | Pop string on the stack and print it
%c    | Pop character on the stack and print it
----- | -----------------------------------------
%px   | Push paramater x (1-9) onto the stack
%i    | Increment the first two paramaters
%Px   | Set variable x (A-Za-z) to pop (persists between calls to format)
%g    | Push variable x (A-Za-z) onto the stack
%'c'  | Push constant string c onto the stack (although it should only be a character, strings are supported)
%{nn} | Push constant number n onto the stack
%l    | Push the length of pop onto the stack (works for numbers)
----- | -----------------------------------------
%+    | Push the sum of pop + pop
%-    | Push the difference of pop2 - pop1 (pop1 was the last value, pop2 was the second last)
%*    | Push the product of pop * pop
%/    | Push the quotient of pop2 / pop1 (if dividing by zero, push 0)
%m    | Push the modulus of pop2 % pop1 (if dividing by zero, push 0)
%&    | Push bitwise and of pop & pop
%\|    | Push bitwise or of pop \| pop
%^    | Push bitwise xor of pop ^ pop
%~    | Push bitwise not of ~pop
----- | -----------------------------------------
%A    | Push logical and of pop && pop
%O    | Push logical or of pop \|\| pop
%!    | Push logical not of !pop
%=    | Push logical equals of pop2 === pop1
%>    | Push logical greater than of pop2 > pop1
%<    | Push logical lesser than of pop2 < pop1
%?    | Initalize a conditional statement
%t    | If pop is true, continue executing, else skip until the next conditional token
%e    | Continue executing unless a condition has been met
%;    | Finialize a conditional statement

### Reverse Mode
Reverse mode is used in both deformat and test methods, and consists of a
slightly different syntax.

Retriving printed items is not supported in a conditional body.

Token | Description
----- | -----------------------------------------
%d    | Push printed number onto the stack
%o    | Push printed octal number onto the stack
%x    | Push printed hexadecimal number onto the stack
%X    | Push printed hexadecimal number onto the stack
%s    | Push printed string onto the stack
%c    | Push printed character onto the stack
%px   | Set paramater x (1-9) to pop

### Windows
As it stands, there is no support for windows terminals.
There are more or less 2 capability versions for windows terminals being the old
windows 7 terminal with ansi support, and the latest being almost purly xterm.

If there are issues we can use cygwin (in a older version of terminfo, check out
/lib/vendor/terminfo/@61a88b7), although may be lacking some capabilities.
Another option is interix, although it appears that is even older.

## Capabilities
A set of capabilities support in the database, along with their terminfo counterpart.
